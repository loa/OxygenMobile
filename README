        =====================

         Requirements
        --------------
 - Running PunBB installation http://punbb.informer.com/

         Recommendations
        -----------------
I will soon release a PunBB extensions that allow a user to specify a style if the user arrives to the forum with a mobile device. This way the user doesn't need to change his/her style everytime (s)he changes device type.
